This is a tool to automate your decisions in an A/B Test Experiment with two alternatives, where 
you want to know which one is betterÂ¹. It is focused on conversion and revenue evaluation, typical in e-commerce.

## How to use

There are two ways of using: using a CSV with one participant per row or a CSV with summary results per day, week or any period. Choose which page you want in the lateral bar.

Â¹ To analyze more than one alternative, you can approximately compare 
them two by two, but avoid this with more than 3. We're working on this feature in the roadmap.
