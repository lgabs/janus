# ðŸ“Š Bayesian A/B Test App

This is a tool to automate your decisions in an A/B Test Experiment with two alternatives, where 
you want to know which one is betterÂ¹. It is focused on conversion and revenue evaluation, typical in e-commerce. It uses Bayesian Statistics to achieve faster and more insightful results. 

No sample size is obligatory, but it is good to estimate it before running your test to have a feel if you can achieve it approximately.

The engine is more powerful than common online websites becasue it measures statistics for 3 variables: 
- conversion rate
- monetary value for conversions (e.g. revenue) 
- average value per impression (e.g. Average Revenue per User)

These are not usual even in famous tools like [abtestguide](https://abtestguide.com/bayesian/) or their [frequentist approach](https://abtestguide.com/calc/), because they only measures for conversion rate.

Â¹ To analyze more than one alternative, you can approximately compare 
them two by two, but avoid this with more than 3. We're working on this feature in the roadmap.


## How to use

There are 3 ways to use, each one comes with default examples to understand:

- Page 'Analyze with Summary Information': most simple use case, you have the summary data for the whole test and want results.
- Page 'Analyze with Per Impression CSV': you have a CSV with results per impression and want results.
- Page 'Analyze with Per Impression CSV': you have a CSV with summary information per day/week/etc and want results.
