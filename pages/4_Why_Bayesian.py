# ðŸ“Š Why Bayesian?

This engine is more powerful than common online websites becasue it measures statistics for 3 very important variables at once: 
- **conversion rate** (e.g., percentage of visits that turn into sales)
- **monetary value for conversions** (e.g., revenue per transaction) 
- **average value per impression** (e.g., Average Revenue per User)

Sometimes, conversion rate is not the best metric for your test: sometimes the most important is if you're bringing more money to the table. That's why ARPU helps you a lot. Revenue also helps you to undestand how your ticket sale is affected between variants.

These are not usual even in famous tools like [abtestguide](https://abtestguide.com/bayesian/) or their [frequentist approach](https://abtestguide.com/calc/), because they only measures for conversion rate.\n


See below the main advantages of this method:
