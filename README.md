Janus is a simple and easy A/B Test Calculator that allows you to run A/B tests and get reports in a few lines of code. 

It's developed mainly for website experiments. While many calculators only account for conversion analysis and consider only two variants, Janus allows multivariant tests and measure _Conversion_, _Averge Ticket_ and _Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)_ over variants, i.e, typical metrics for tests in marketplaces. 

The engine name is an analogy to _Janus_, the god of changes and transitions.


## Installation

Janus is distributed in [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/janus-web-ab-testing/). You can install it by using:
```
pip install janus-web-ab-testing
```

You can now run a quick example of a A/B test:
```
from janus.variant import Variant
from janus.experiment import WebsiteExperiment

variant_A = Variant(
    name="A",
    impressions=1000, 
    conversions=100, 
    revenue=10000
)
variant_B = Variant(
    name="B",
    impressions=1000, 
    conversions=120, 
    revenue=9000
)
variants = [variant_A, variant_B]

experiment = WebsiteExperiment(variants, baseline_variant="A")
experiment.run()
experiment.print_reports()
```

See more in the [quickstart notebook](examples/Janus%20Quickstart.ipynb).

## The Janus Website

My plan is to build a website to showcase the Janus library and to provide a simple interface to run A/B tests. However, only the library is almost ready, and the next steps would be:
- build a backend with FastAPI using the library
- build a frontend (JavaScript maybe)
- deploy the website
